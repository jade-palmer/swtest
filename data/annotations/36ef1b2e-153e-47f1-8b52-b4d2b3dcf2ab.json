Camera pans toward the right, revealing multiple audience members sitting along the side of the stage, and Unknown_Member1 entering, dressed in black turtleneck and black pants. The entering person closes a door behind them and walks onto the stage. They lift a piece of paper to read as they step up on the milk crate.

Unknown_Member2 (long dark hair pulled into a ponytail, black turtleneck, black pants) enters the frame via stage left, holding a cue card in their left hand. They address their fellow performer and the audience, before taking position facing away from the audience upstage left.
